1. Main Function (Display menu/Selecting Operations):
As a user, I want to select a mathematical operation I wish to perform so that I can specify the type of calculation I need.

2. Standard Arithmetic Function:
As a user, I want to be able to perform standard arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, division, and multiplication, so that I can calculate basic mathematical expressions. 
As a developer, I want to implement error handling in the program to ensure it can handle potential issues such as division by zero and the entry of invalid inputs such as non-numeric values.

3. Trigonometric Functions:
As a user, I want to be able to calculate trigonometry values with this calculator like sin, cos, tan, inverse sin, inverse cos and inverse tan for a given angle or value, so that I can solve trigonometry problems
As a developer, I want to ensure that the calculator system will be able to handle errors. Ensuring invalid input will not break and will inform the user about the error.

4. Exponents:

5. Square Root Calculation:
As a user, I want to be able to key in a value and get the square root value, so that i can solve square root problem given a value. As a developer, I want to ensure that the inputs are valid and will be able to handle invalid inputs such as a string.
 
6. Percentage Calculation:
As a user, I want to be able to find out the percentage of a total value given a value. I also want to be able to find the value of a total value given the percentage. So that I am able to solve problems with percentage. 
As a developer, I want to ensure that the inputs are valid and will be able to handle invalid inputs such as a string.
